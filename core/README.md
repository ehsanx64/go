# go-examples/core

This directory contains example source code on core Go language features and techniques. It started as a hand-typed collection of examples at [Go by Example](https://gobyexample.com), but gradually I've added more code and hopefully I'll continue to do so.

As my main goal is to play with the language and learn by doing/grokking, you'll find a lot of absurdities, be careful ;-)
